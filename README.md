## About The Project

[Repository](https://github.com/priyasu-cx/Innerve-CR)

[Website](https://connecten-website.vercel.app/)

[App](https://github.com/priyasu-cx/Innerve-CR/blob/main/Mobile%20App/APK/connecten.apk)

Introducing our project, a one-click solution designed to simplify the networking process and connect individuals with similar interests. We understand that attending meetups and gatherings can be challenging, especially when it comes to meeting and connecting with like-minded individuals. Our goal is to make this process easier and more hassle-free than ever before.

Our solution utilizes peer-to-peer nearby sharing technology to enable the seamless transfer of digital identities. This allows users to share their information quickly and efficiently, leading to more productive networking opportunities. Additionally, our solution is designed to work in areas with low network coverage, making it accessible to a wider range of users.

One unique aspect of our solution is the gamification element. Users earn coins for each new connection they make, which they can redeem for bursts. Bursts enable users to share their profile with everyone present, even those who are far away. This feature incentivizes users to actively seek out new connections and expand their network.

We understand the importance of privacy, and as such, our solution is designed with user privacy in mind. Users have complete control over the information they share and with whom. We take measures to ensure that personal data is not misused in any way.

Our solution is perfect for individuals who attend meetups, conferences, and other gatherings. With just one click, users can connect with others who share similar interests, opening up new opportunities for growth and learning. Whether you're looking to expand your professional network or simply meet new friends, our solution makes it easy and hassle-free.
